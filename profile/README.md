Genome Function Initiative Oxford is a GitHub repository for all Welcome Discovery Award related projects.

This is a joint collaboration between [Hughes](https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/about/our-divisions/nuffield-division-of-clinical-laboratory-sciences/nuffield-division-of-clinical-laboratory-sciences-research/hughes-group) and [Davies](https://www.imm.ox.ac.uk/research/research-groups/davies-group-genome-function-and-advanced-cellular-therapy-development) Groups at the [MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine (MRC WIMM)](https://www.imm.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford.

Here are some tools that we made publicly available:
+ [UpStreamPipeline](https://github.com/Genome-Function-Initiative-Oxford/UpStreamPipeline): "upstream" includes the necessary steps to go from raw data output (usually fastq files) to a format which is visually interpretable by a researcher (e.g., bigwigs). These upstream pipelines allow wet-lab scientists to reproducibly analyse their own data without needing any prior knowledge of bioinformatics. These pipelines are built using the snakemake framework and designed to be both user-friendly and to combat the issue of reproducibility in genomic data analysis. Among these pipelines is present [CATCH-UP](https://dx.doi.org/10.3791/65633): A High-Throughput Upstream-Pipeline for Bulk ATAC-Seq and ChIP-Seq Data, Published on 22/09/2023
+ [REgulamentary](https://github.com/Genome-Function-Initiative-Oxford/REgulamentary): a Python-based Snakemake pipeline built to genome-wide annotate cis-regulatory elements, from sequenced data, in a cell-type specific manner. Currently under revision.
